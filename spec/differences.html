		<h1>How Nougat differs</h1>
		Here's what you need to know if you're coming from another language: <b>Nougat does not syntactically derive from other languages.</b> It is a new language that is designed to be easy to use and understand, 
		while also being powerful and flexible. To make a language that is intuitive by design, we had to make a few compromises to familiarity, <b>but this is a good thing! Here's why:</b><br>
		<ul>
			<li>It follows an "anyone can code" approach, enabling new learners to get their project working as they want it to faster</li>
			<li>It eliminates many inefficiencies found in even relatively modern programming languages</li>
			<li>It is designed to look clean and easy to read and write</li>
		</ul>
		For instance, let's take a look at the following code snippet:
		<div class="codeblock"><br>log {Hello World!}<br><br></div>
		It outputs:
		<code>Hello World!</code>
		<br><br>But if we do:
		<div class="codeblock"><br>log {"Hello World!"} // note the added quotes<br><br></div>
		It outputs: <code>"Hello World!"</code> including the quotes you've added, which might not be what you want.
		<br>To understand why this happens, we must keep in mind that <b>Nougat is a highly dynamic language with input-based types.</b><br>
		<br><b>Inputs in Nougat are different kinds of brackets</b>, which are used to determine the type of data you want to plug into a function, such as a string, a variable, or a mathematical expression.
		In this case, <b>we should focus on the <code>{}</code> input</b> (or the "literal" input, as I like to call it.). What this does is that it takes what's inside the brackets,<b> not</b> inside quotes, and dynamically determines it as a string or a number.
		<b>It is used for "literal" values</b>, which are values that are not variables and do not change.
		<br><br>So to sum things up, <code>{}</code> is for literals, <code>()</code> is for variables, <code>[]</code> is for plugging the output of a function into another, and <code>&lt;&gt;</code> is for mathematical expressions.
		All you need to do is enter whatever you want to compute inside the brackets, no quotes needed, and Nougat will take care of the rest.
		<br><br>
		<h1 id="sect-objects">The concept of objects</h1>
		Nougat is not entirely object-oriented <b>in the traditional sense</b>. In fact, Nougat has a completely different concept from languages like JavaScript of what an object is.
		<b>In Nougat, an object is more like a sprite in Scratch.</b> A folder that contains all code and assets related to a specific thing. 
		For example, if you want to create a game, you would create a folder for each character, and inside that folder, you would put all the code and assets related to that character.
		<br><br>Scripts inside an object, when bundled inside a fully compiled project, <b>are immediately "activated"</b> and executing whatever is inside <code>when {run} {}</code> and/or listening for events broadcasted from other objects with <code>send {myEvent}</code>.
